        In this stage, there will be <b>one last slider task</b>. The time limit is 10 minutes.
            As before, if you reach the target you will receive {{ C.REWARD }} points. If you don't reach the target, you will receive 0 points.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Pair</b></h5>
        After completing the slider task, <b>you will be paired with another participant.</b>
            A pair will always consist of one member who reached the target, and one who didn't. So, if you reached the target
            you will be paired with someone who did not, and vice versa.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Your pair will be randomly assigned to at least one other participant, who will decide how to allocate a bonus of {{ C.BONUS }} points between the two of you.</b>
            The other participant will be told who reached the target in the pair, and their decision will directly affect your earnings. <br>
            <br>
            You won't know the identities of the other person in your pair or the person making the redistribution decision.
            If your pair is shown to more than one participant, we will randomly choose one of the decisions made for your pair to determine
            the amount you will earn.<br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Redistribution decision</b></h5>
            <b>You will also have to decide how
            to allocate a bonus of {{ C.BONUS }} points between the two members of one or two randomly chosen pairs of other participants.</b>
            Your decision will directly affect their earnings.<br>
            <br>You won't know the identities of these participants,
            and they won't know who made the redistribution decision for them. You will never have to make a redistribution decision for a pair to which you belong.
